- Complaints
 - Not enough time - 24 hours in day
  - The amount of things that you are required to do
  - The amount of time it takes you to complete those thing
  - Downtime 
    - too little 
    - too much
 - Not getting all of the knowledge from the Lecture
    - Your primary source of information is your reads and resources
    - Deepen theoretical background
    - The opportunity to clarify and misunderstandings
    - See how a concept is applied in code
 - We waste our time on documentation
    - Part of the knowledge you are expected to develop is how to effectively use documentation
 - We don't have time to practice
  - Labs are your practise
  - Stretch Goals
  - Stack Learning
    - topic 1
    - topic 2 : practise topic 1 and 2
    - topic 3 : topic 1 , 2 ,3
  - Consider changing your focus when doing labs, think about the concept that you learnt while working through the lab and future lab.
  - 401 is a totally different beast from the previous courses
  - By the end of this course you will have next to no "hand holding" and you'll know how to deal with it
