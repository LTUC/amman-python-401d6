# Permissions & Postgresql

It's time to move to a production ready database.

SQLite has it's place, but often you'll need a more robust solution.

Postgresql is a great choice. And with the help of Docker using Postgresql at production scale is much easier.

We will also be adding `permissions` to our Django apps so that users are allowed appropriate actions.
