# Error Reading

Execute `errors.py`, read the errors, and fix one by one.

Don't fix any bugs beyond what the error stack trace tells you, even if you spot them in the source code before then.

The goal here is the error reading more than the error fixing.

**Question:** Do you find it more helpful to read from the beginning (aka top) of the error, or the end/bottom?
