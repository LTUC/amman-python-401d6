# Django REST Framework & Docker

The combination of Django and Django REST Framework is a powerful and fast way to develop APIs.

Docker is great way to guard against the dreaded `but it works on my machine!` developer curse.

Today we'll work on converting a Django app into a proper API then wrap it up in a Docker container.
