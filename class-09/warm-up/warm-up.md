# Warm-Up Exercise

> Python can tell when two things are equivalent for built in types. Can we get that for our custom classes as well?

```python
class Duck:
    def __init__(self, name, category):
        self.name = name
        self.category = category

    def rename_to_dunder_method(self, other):
        """some dreamy method that "magically" returns True if ducks are "equal"
        """

        # equality logic goes here
        pass
```

## Feature Tasks

- Rename `rename_to_dunder_method` with the corrent dunder method.
- Implement logic for two ducks being equal.
