# Overview of Statistics

##Statistics

A combination of the analysis, collection, interpretation, and representation of numerical data.


---

## Probability
The likelihood that an event will occur

**Probability Distribution**
A function that provides the probabilities for every possible event.

---

## Discrete and Continous

**Discrete**

Roll six dice

**Continous**

Length of time for trip home depending on when you depart

---
## Measures of Central Tendency

Measures of central tendency are often called averages and describe central or typical values for a probability distribution.
- Mean
- Median
- Mode

---

A die was rolled ten times and we got the following numbers: 4, 5, 4, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, and 1.

What is the mean? The median? The mode?

## Measures of Dispersion

**Dispersion**, also called variability, is the extent to which a probability distribution is stretched or squeezed.

**Variance**: The variance is the expected value of the squared deviation from the mean. It describes how far a set of numbers is spread out from their mean.

**Standard deviation**: It's the square root of the variance.

**Range**: This is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset.

**Interquartile range:** Also called the midspread or middle 50%, it is the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles,

## Correlation

The measures we have discussed so far only considered single variables. In contrast, correlation describes the statistical relationship between two variables: In positive correlation, both variables move in the same direction In negative correlation, the variables move in opposite directions In zero correlation, the variables are not related

**Note:** Correlation does not imply causation.

E.g. Sleeping with shoes on correlates with a waking headache.
