# Prework - Editor Setup

## Tasks

During the 401 Python course to come you will be writing more Python than you can possibly imagine. To help ease yourself into the experience it is important that you start with a well-established editor configuration for writing Python (this includes HTML, CSS, and JS as well!).

### Editor
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} will be the standard editor for this course, though you are welcome to utilize any editor you prefer as long as it meets the following expectations:
1. [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig){:target="_blank"} package installed (some editors have built-in support) - There is a package for almost any conceivable editor you might choose.
  - If you're using an editor that does not have an extension available for this package, rethink your life choices.
  - This package will dictate code style based on a `.editorconfig` file which we will review during our first day of class.

Please read (participate at your discretion) the following tutorial: [VS Code Python Tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial){:target="_blank"}.
  - _IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not install Anaconda. Just skip those references, and follow the OS-based installations for this tutorial._
