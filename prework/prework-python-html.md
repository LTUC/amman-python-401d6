# Prework - Tools, Python, HTML, CSS, JS

## Tasks

During the 401 Python course to come you will be writing more Python than you can possibly imagine. To help ease yourself into the experience it is important that you start limbering up your Python muscles. Be sure to spend at least *two hours each day* writing Python code.  What you write is not as important as generally exercising your skills in thinking in Python.

## More on Web Dev

During the 401 Python course, we will be learning a great deal of Python. But we will also be making use of technologies related to web development that are not Python. A solid working knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS is important for any web developer.

Spend the time between now and the start of class sharpening your HTML/CSS/JS skills.

### Refresh HTML/CSS/JS

If you are a complete beginner, then may I suggest an account with either [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/){:target="_blank"} or [CodeAcademy](http://codeacademy.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Once you are signed up, either site has a number of quality tutorials that cover HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  Pick some, and work through them. Then pick the next in line and keep going. Spend at least an hour a day working on this.

Another great resource for all of the above is [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com){:target="_blank"}. Once you sign up for an account there, you should be able to work your way all the way through the Advanced Algorithm Scripting section of work. It does take time though, so pace yourself over several days/weeks.

## Submitting Your Work

To complete this assignment submit a screenshot of your SoloLearn Python certificate in Canvas.

_Because this is not an HTML/CSS/JS course, those assignments will not be graded in any detail._
