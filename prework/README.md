# Code 401: Advanced Software Development in Python

## Pre-work

This is the mandatory pre-work for Code 401: Python that counts as 5 full coding assignments (effectively a week's worth of work).
When this course nears its start date, you will be invited to an online portal named Canvas where you can confirm that you've completed this prework and claim credit.

Start on the pre-work as soon as you can and be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to complete it.
Allow yourself more time than you think you will need so that you can take breaks and not get overwhelmed.

### Operating systems

- Mac
  - 10.14 Mojave or greater is preferred.
- Linux
  - Ubuntu 18.04 or greater
  - If you use different flavor of Linux that could work but you'll need to assume the technical issues may arise.
- Windows
  - Windows users are **strongly encouraged** to dual boot into Ubuntu.
    - Here is a good [tutorial](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/dual-boot-windows-10-linux/) on dual booting Windows 10 and Ubuntu.
    - **WARNING** You must assume responsibility for changes made to your computer. Codefellows can help but is not responsible for computer set up issues.
  - If you stick with Windows then computers are **absolutely required** to have the latest version of **Windows 10 Pro**
  - Windows users should install WSL in order to run Linux as a sub system. See `Set Up` section for details
