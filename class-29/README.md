# Django Custom User

The official Django documentation highly recommends using a custom User model for new projects. Why? Because it's a major pain if you need to add user features down the road.

Some kinds of projects may have authentication requirements for which Djangoâ€™s built-in User model is not always appropriate. For instance, on some sites it makes more sense to use an email address as your identification token instead of a username.
