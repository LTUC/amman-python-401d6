# Contributing

Thank you for help improving DjangoX. All kinds of contributions are welcome. Please note that this starter project is *intentionally* basic: I don't plan to add environment variables, Docker, or other production-appropriate features as I feel they will overwhelm beginners. But I'm open to suggestions!

Please submit an Issue or even better a PR and I'll review :)
