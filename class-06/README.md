-  OOP
  - Not every base class is abstract
  - Anytime you have an abstract it is intended to eb sued as a Base Class for some other class.
  - If you want to use the abstract @decorators to mark your methods as abstract, you must inherit from the ABC class MyClass(ABC)
-  Linked List
  - insert adds to the beginning of the list
  - append add to the end of the list
- __str__ vs __repr__
  - The __repr__ is the formal representation of your data structure
  Node(5)
  - The __str__ is human readbale string representation of your data strucutre

## Testing
How can we know that our applicatoin work

- Acceptance Criteria
- Test Cases

## Think of your program like one big algorithom
prompt if the user wants to play
if  y call start game else
exit
## Recursively define each step down until you have functional units
define start game function
roll_dice(x: int) -> List[int, int]
calculating_score((1,2,3)) -> int
