# Lab: Cryptography

## Overview

Today we'll be tackling a cryptographic classic - the Caesar Cipher.

Your job will be to devise a method to encrypt a message that can then be decrypted when supplied with the corresponding key.

But don't stop there! You'll also need to devise a way to decipher the encrypted message event when you do NOT have the key!

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

- Create an `encrypt` function that takes in a plain text phrase and a numeric shift.
  - the phrase will then be `shifted` that many letters.
    - E.g. encrypt('abc',1) would return 'bcd'
    = E.g. encrypt('abc', 10) would return 'klm'
  - shifts that exceed 26 should wrap around
    - E.g. encrypt('abc',27) would return 'bcd'
- shifts that push a letter out or range should wrap around
  - E.g. encrypt('zzz',1) would return 'aaa' 
- Create a `decrypt` function that takes in encrypted text and numeric shift which will restore the encrypted text back to its original form when correct key is supplied.
- create a `crack` function that will decode the cipher so that an encrypted message can be transformed into its original state **WITHOUT** access to the key.
- Devise a method for the computer to determine if code was broken with minimal human guidance.

## Implementation Notes

- In order to accomplish a certain task you'll need access to a `corpus` of English words.
  - A search on something like `python list of english words` should get you going.


### User Acceptance Tests

The application must...

- encrypt a string with a given `shift`
- decrypt a previously encrypted string with the same `shift`
- encryption should handle upper and lower case letters
- encryption should allow non-alpha characters but ignore them, including white space
- decrypt encrypted version of `It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.` **WITHOUT** knowing the shift used.
- refer to supplied unit tests.

## Stretch Goals

- Research the VigenÃ¨re cipher
- Find some examples of ROT13 encrypted punchlines, spoilers, etc.
- Break the code for a message written in language other than English.


## Configuration

Use `poetry` to create `caesar-cipher` project.

```console
> $ poetry new caesar-cipher
```

Use the folder created by Poetry as the root of your project's git repository.
