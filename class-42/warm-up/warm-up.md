# Warm-Up Exercise

> Three Things with a LinkedList

Given a LinkedList of integers, create method/s to accomplish 3 separate goals...

- Find the sum of all values
- Find the product of all values
- Create a list of each value squared

```
(3) -> (4) -> (5) -> NULL
sum = 12
product = 60
squares = [9,16,25]

```

## Feature Tasks

- Consider ways to avoid writing separate methods but accomplish each goal.
- Consider an approach that would work for other types of collections as well. 
  - E.g. Tree or Graph
