# Game of Greed 2

For _Game of Greed 2_ we'll add the ability for user to interact with our game from the command line.

There are (at least) 2 key areas of risk.

1. The modules created previously must be integrated into a Game class.
1. We need a way to automate the verification of the game's behavior.

- Create a tool to automate testing of our Game
- Patch Python's built in functionality
