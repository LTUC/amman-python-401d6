# Lab: React IV - Front End Deployment

## Overview

It's time to go live with your front end!

There are a lot of great (and cheap) deployment options. One of the best is [Vercel](https://vercel.com/){:target="_blank"}

The Vercel platform was built by creators of Next.js so it's bound to be good.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

- Refer to [Deploying Your Next.js App](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/deploying-nextjs-app/){:target="_blank"}
- Deploy your Next.js app.
  - An app you build fresh just for this lab.
  - The app you built for previous lab.
  - Convert one of your "vanilla" React app's to Next.js
  - Really, anything.
  - As long as you created it with Next.js

## Implementation Notes

- You'll need a Vercel account and to link it to Github.
  - The Deployment instructions above will walk you through it.
