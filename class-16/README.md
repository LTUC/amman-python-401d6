# Intro to Machine Learning

"Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.

As computing resources become cheaper we can "train" our algorithms to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do do." - Wikipedia

In the old days the the cost of computing power was prohibitive, so it was expensive to allow our algorithms to "learn by doing."

These days computing power is cheaper. Though cheap is not the same as free.
