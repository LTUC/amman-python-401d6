# Warm-Up Exercise

> Match the correct depth-first traversal with the output.

```text
       {A}
  {B}      {C}
{D} {E}  {F} {G}
```

## Feature Tasks

Given the tree above, different traversals will print the node's value, traverse to one child, and traverse to the remaining child - in the order specified.

The traversal must be `in-order`,`pre-order` or `post-order`.

Supply the traversal that would generate the following outputs...

`D,E,B,F,G,C,A`
`A,B,D,E,C,F,G`
`D,B,E,A,F,C,G`
