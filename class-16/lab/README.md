# Lab: Machine Learning Intro

## Overview

A key developer skill is the ability to use internet resources effectively. Especially when learning a new topic.

For this lab you'll be converting an excellent tutorial from a couple years ago. Does it still work? Let's find out!

**NOTE**: you don't have to understand all of the code in the tutorial yet. Get it working first, in the process it will become more familiar.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

- Your task is to create a baseline classification model by following (and modifying when needed) the [Practical Text Classification With Python and Keras](https://realpython.com/python-keras-text-classification/){:target="_blank"} tutorial into a running Jupyter Notebook.
  - To accomplish your primary task you'll need install several libraries and external assets.
- A big part of this lab is building resilience when faced with an incomplete solution.
- Because most of the time that's what internet is going to give you.

## Implementation Notes

- You are only required to build the Baseline Model.
- Your project will require several dependencies to be installed. Figure out which ones.
- Your project will require downloading external assets to particular locations, and with particular names.
- Some example code may cause errors. Troubleshoot the errors and see if you can fix them.
  - **Hint** - you can

## Setup

- Create a `text-classifier` repository on GitHub
- Name notebook `text_classifier.ipynb`

## Configuration

Use `poetry` to initialize `text-classifier` project.

```console
> $ cd text-classifier
> $ poetry init -n
```

## Testing

- No automated testing requirements for this lab.

Refer to [Lab Submission Instructions](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs/){:target="_blank"} for detailed instructions.

## Stretch Goals

- Complete the full tutorial using Keras
- Summarize in your own words what each code cell is doing.
- Choose another dataset to classify.
- See if you can "fiddle with the knobs" and get a higher accuracy rate from baseline model.
