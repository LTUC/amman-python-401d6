# Lab: Data Structure Obstacle Course

## Overview

We're learning each new Data Structure by itself. But the real magic happens when you combine them.  This lab is a chance to work with many data structures at once in a data structure obstacle course.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

Given a binary tree, where the value of each node is a linked_list, where the value of each linked_list is a value of a list of integers, write a function that will return the following in a tuple -  Sum of all list values, the largest value, the smallest value, and the value furthest removed from 0.

Determine the Big O for time and space.

## Implementation Notes

It can be hard to visualize this tree of linked-lists of lists of ints. So it will be crucial to know when to separate concepts, and when to bring them back together.

**TIP**: print out the tree that's passed in from provided unit test.

## Setup

- Create a `dsa-obstacle-course` repository on GitHub

## Configuration

Use `poetry` to initialize `dsa-obstacle-course` project.

## Testing

- Pass the supplied unit tests

Refer to [Lab Submission Instructions](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs/){:target="_blank"} for detailed instructions.

## Stretch Goals

- Add more unit tests to cover edge cases
- Raise exceptions for missing values
- Change the nesting of the data structures
- Change result type to be Dictionary instead of tuple
