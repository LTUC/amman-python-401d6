# Warm-Up Exercise

Find common elements in two linked lists

```python
def find_common(linked_a, linked_b):
    common = []
    # your code here
    return common
```

## Feature Tasks

- Given two linked lists, efficiently return list of common elements using a `set` instead of `dictionary`
- **STRETCH** Describe a world where this could be done as a one liner.
